1>create a class 
2>taking a user input from the scanner class
3>creating a variable assigning to a int value 
4>creating a another class and a static method
5>creating int numbers and assigning value to them
6>fib1=0,fib2=1,fib3;
7>if we need to print the value of fib1 and fib2
5>using a for loop control construct initial a value to a variable
6>and then condition check the value is lesser than or equal to a
7>increment the  i value
8>then write a condition to a value of fib3
9>fib3=fib1+fib2;
10>print the value of fib3
11>then swap the numbers of fib1=fib2,fib2=fib3;
12>return a parameter n
13>while using static method we need to call it by using classname.static method with parameters
14>output format will be:enter the number 5
15>0,1,1,2,3,5,8

1>create a class 
2>taking a user input from the scanner class
3>creating a variable assigning to a int value 
4>creating a another class and a static method
5>creating int numbers and assigning value to them
6>using a for loop control construct initial a value to a variable
7>and then condition check the value i is lesser than or equal to a and i is lesser then or equal to b
8>increment the  i value
9>then write a if condition to check a divide with i equal to zero and b divide with i equal to zero
10>a%i==0 && b%i==0
11>print the value of i
12>12>return a parameter a or b
13>while using static method we need to call it by using classname.static method with parameters
14>output format will be:enter the number 10
15>enter the another number :20
16>output=10
